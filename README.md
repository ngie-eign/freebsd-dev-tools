# freebsd-dev-tools

SysAdmin and developer tools written specifically for FreeBSD.

The tools are written in a variety of languages, each with their own respective
trade-offs and constraints.

At time of writing, the Python and shell tools are generally production ready,
whereas the Golang and Rust equivalents have various degrees of quality/flux.
